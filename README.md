Spade
=====

I was annoyed at the lack of a suitable (Pinta is a glitchy nightmare, GIMP is overcomplicated and not very useful for pixel art, etc.)
equivalent of Paint.NET for Linux, and was unable to do pixel art for my games.
If you want something done well, you have to do it yourself it seems.

I'll put up a changelog here at some point.

Developing
==========
Note that most contributors are probably looking to develop on the editing functions rather than
the framework of the application itself. If this includes you, head over to the
[Core plugin repository](https://github.com/Spade-Editor/Core) and see the instructions there. You
will still be required to set up Spade for development.

1. Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/Spade-Editor/Spade`).
2. Import the source into the IDE of your choice.
3. Add `lib/weblaf-XXX.jar` to the build path of the project.
4. Run `Start.java` (Found in `src/heroesgrave/spade/main/`). Make sure it works. If it doesn't and you can't work out why, create an issue.
5. (Optional) You will probably want to install the `Core` plugin, which contains the majority of
the editing functions. More information is available [here](https://github.com/Spade-Editor/Core#developing).
6. Make whatever changes you want.
7. Commit your changes and make a pull request.
